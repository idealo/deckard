Deckard is a wrapper library for Spring Kafka. It provides an easy solution to write messages to Kafka in a purely declarative and transparent manner.
It lets you write Kafka messages without having to worry much about complicated configurations. 

The Deckard library enables you to easily create Kafka producers by just declaring interfaces like this:

````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic")
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, MyDto> {}
````

This will provide your application with a functioning message producer for Kafka.

GenericProducer provides the following methods for your convenience

````java
void send(V data)
void send(K messageKey, V data)
void sendEmpty(K messageKey) // sends tomb stone message 
````

### How To:

You only have to define your producers via interfaces as shown above.
Then add the annotation `@KafkaProducer` to your interface to configure the target topic.

**_And that's it!_** 
  
Everything else will be handled automatically. You may configure target brokers and so on as usual
via the properties which are provided by Spring Kafka. They will be picked up by our
bootstrapping mechanism. 

### Notes:
#### Serializers
You may set a default serializer for your keys and values as usual via the Spring Kafka properties. 
However, if you want to use different serializers on individual producers, you may specify them as classes or bean 
references in the producer definition:

````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", keySerializer = LongSerializer.class, valueSerializer = JsonSerializer.class)
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, MyDto> {}
````
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", keySerializerBean = "myKeySerializer", valueSerializerBean = "myValueSerializer")
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<MyKey, MyValue> {}
````

Note that bean references have higher precedence than classes. You are also able to mix definition or omit certain ones 
if you want to partly use the Spring Kafka properties. E.g.:

````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", valueSerializer = JsonSerializer.class)
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, MyDto> {}
````
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", keySerializer = LongSerializer.class, valueSerializerBean = "myValueSerializer")
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<MyKey, MyValue> {}
````

#### Bootstrap Servers
Per default, KafkaProducers will use bootstrap servers resolved from the KafkaProperties where producer bootstrap servers 
from `spring.kafka.producer.bootstrap-servers` overwrite global bootstrap servers from `spring.kafka.bootstrap-servers`. 
If you need to define different bootstrap servers per KafkaProducer, you can also specify them in the producer definition:
 
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", bootstrapServers = "localhost:9092")
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, MyDto> {}
````
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", bootstrapServers = {"192.168.1.1:9092", "192.168.1.2:9092"})
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, MyDto> {}
````

#### Payload Encryption
In case you want to encrypt your payload, you could either use a custom serializer as described above or use Deckard's 
built-in AES encryption support:
 
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", encryptionPassword = "<my_secret_pass>", encryptionSalt = "<my_secret_salt>")
        interface EncryptingProducer extends GenericProducer<Long, String> {}
````
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "my.topic", encryptionPassword = "${pass.from.property}", encryptionSalt = "${salt.from.property}")
        interface EncryptingSpelProducer extends GenericProducer<Long, String> {}
````

Encryption works with any serializer as Deckard just wraps the provided pay load serializer with encryption functionality.

In order to ease usage on the consumer's end as well, Deckard provides a matching 
`DecryptingDeserializer` as well.

#### Property Placeholder Support
The parameters `topic` and `bootstrapServers` are also able to resolve property placeholders:
````java
@KafkaProducer(topic = "${topic.name.from.property}", bootstrapServers = "${bootstrap-servers.from.property}")
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, String> {}
````

#### Granular Producer Property Control
In case you need more granular control over your producer's properties without sacrificing the beauty of less boilerplate configuration, you now can configure any producer using all of Spring Kafka's properties.

You need to set up two things in order to get the ball rolling. First, give your producer a specific ID:
````java
@KafkaProducer(id = "orders", topic = "some-topic")
public interface MyProducer extends GenericProducer<String, String> {}
````

Second, configure any property you already know from Spring Kafka's `KafkaProperties` in the application.yaml (or anywhere you like):
````yaml
deckard:
  properties:
    orders:
      producer:
        bootstrapServers: localhost:12345
      ssl:
        keyStorePassword: some-password
      ...
````

That's it.

So, what's happening here. `KafkaProducer` properties are resolved (and possibly overridden) in the following order:

* Spring Kafka managed `KafkaProperties`
* Deckard managed context properties by ID as described above
* Properties defined in the `KafkaProducer` annotation directly
* (A generated client-id per producer)

The last step is required in order to ensure unique client IDs per globally. I.e. any previously defined client-id will be ignored. However, you can disable this behavior and define your own client ID:
 ````yaml
deckard:
  properties:
    orders:
      client-id: my-order-client
  features:
    auto-generate-client-id:
      enabled: false
````


#### Notes on Versioning and Compatibility

Deckard was originally built on Spring Kafka 2.0.x which is only compatible with Spring Boot 2.0.x.
To go forward with development for Spring Boot 2.1.x, but also support projects based on Spring Boot 2.0.x, we introduced the following versioning scheme:

- 2.x -> supports Spring Kafka 3.2.x and is compatible with Spring Boot 3.3.x
- 1.x -> supports Spring Kafka 2.2.x and is compatible with Spring Boot 2.1.x
- 0.x (LEGACY) -> supports Spring Kafka 2.1.x and is compatible with Spring Boot 2.0.x

We will try to add new features in both versions as long as possible.

#### About the project
